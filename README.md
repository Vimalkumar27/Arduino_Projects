# Arduino Projects
> This repository contains Arduino-based robotics projects including a Voice Controlled Car (Bluetooth), a Line Following Car, and a Human Following Car.
> All projects are developed using the Arduino IDE with C/C++ and utilize modules like HC-05 Bluetooth, 3 Channel Array sensor, and ultrasonic sensors.For motor movements L298N driver is used.
> Each car demonstrates different levels of autonomy and control logic through embedded systems and sensor integration.
> Libraries and packages can be installed through Arduino IDE itself.
