# Arduino Projects
> This repository contains Arduino-based robotics projects including a Voice Controlled bot (Bluetooth), a Line Following bot, and a Human Following bot.
> All projects are developed using the Arduino IDE with C/C++ and utilize modules like HC-05 Bluetooth, 3 Channel Array sensor, and ultrasonic sensors.For motor movements and power supply L298N driver and lithium ion battery(12V) is used.
> Each car demonstrates different levels of autonomy and control logic through embedded systems and sensor integration.
> Libraries and packages can be installed through Arduino IDE itself.
